# Roleplay Game Manager #

This is the beginnings of a combined Windows Phone, and potentially Windows Desktop application for managing various aspects of roleplaying games, from both the DM and player perspectives. The utilities are intended to be game agnostic, so shouldn't be specific to one or few games, but features may reach a point where templates could be created for games. Intended initial features:
 - Note pages
 - Automatic links between notes
 - Customization of note link aliases
 - Note synchronization across devices (likely through OneDrive)
 - Dice roller
 - Automatic clickable dice expressions
 - Tabletop maps (draw tools)
 - Actor tracking on maps (position, properties, initiative)
 - Link actors with notes (simple character sheets)
 - Note/actor properties
